I need you to prepare a set of search terms, keywords, etc. to conduct a literature review on questions. Specifically, we are trying to determine how questions function as a component of interdisciplinary discourse, and more importantly how they can be structured or presented to foster additional questions as well as more specific questions or creative approaches to domains and elements of domains. It is important for this literature search that we capture approaches to question asking and question elaboration across disiplines: interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity is an important aspect of what we are trying to study. Also, it is important that we capture teams focused research and prioritize experiential studies in which teams (ideally across disciplines) exchange and develop questions in settings such as workshops, hackathons, conferences, meetings, etc.
