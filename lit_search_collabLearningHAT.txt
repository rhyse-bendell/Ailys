I need you to conduct a literature search on collaborative learning in human-AI teams. The search needs to cover topics such as how teams search for, acquire, and happen upon information and how they operate over that information to develop shared or individual knowledge sets. Further, the search needs to include how the inclusion of AI in teams (e.g., as Centaur human-AI dyads, as team coaches or assistants, as separate team members) impacts the ways in which teams acquire information/knowledge and how they learn with a focus on ways in which AI inclusion positively and negatively impacts individual and team learning. It is important that the literature search cover high pressure domains such as military, first responders, healthcare.
